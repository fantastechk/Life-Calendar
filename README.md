I don't know yet. If you're like to follow along with the development you can read the [Developer's Log](https://github.com/wvdk/Life-Calendar/tree/master/Developer's%20Log).

## Roadmap

### July â€“ August: Something Basic
Create a basic interface for adding data a basic model which saves to disk. Any amount of actual functionality, regardless of scope or polish, is a win at this stage. Just some foundation that can (in the future) be iterated upon, hopefully into something worthwhile. Then I should make a beta release and share it with friends and family.

### August - September: Something With Promise
Begin sharing the beta with anyone willing to take a look. Getting ready for a the App Store.
