What is Life Calendar? Short answer...

![Mockups 1](./Screenshots%20and%20mockups/Mockups%201.png)

I don't know yet.

If you'd like to follow along with the development you can read the [Developer's Log](https://github.com/wvdk/Life-Calendar/tree/master/Developer's%20Log) and watch the [Project boards](https://github.com/wvdk/Life-Calendar/projects).

## Roadmap

###  Something Basic (July – August)
Create a basic interface for adding data a basic model which saves to disk. Any amount of actual functionality, regardless of scope or polish, is a win at this stage. Just some foundation that can (in the future) be iterated upon, hopefully into something worthwhile. Then I should make a beta release and share it with friends and family.

### Something With Promise (August – September)
Begin sharing the beta with anyone willing to take a look. Getting ready for a the App Store. For this release I'm thinking it should look something like:

### Something Releasable (Late 2017)
- Document based app - you can choose where to save the file. And you can open prexisting files.
- Easy to use UI - mostly pretty, but probably nothing impressive yet.
- Stretch Goal: Should have a Life Expectancy Estimator built in.

### Something With Polish and Style (???)
- A nice onboarding flow.
- Lots of little embelishments that make the app feel magical.
- Included exmples of famous people's timelines.

### Something Actually Good (???)
- Other views (like the Weeks view but better), and other expositions (like the Life Expectacy Estimator but better).
