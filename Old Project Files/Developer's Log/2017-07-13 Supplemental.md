Developer's Log, Supplemental, 2017-07-13

10:21 AM: It's my goal to be an Ultra Productive Developer™,  but some days I miss that by a long mile. Some thinking needs to be done on the subject because I absolutely hate those days. So, without further ado, here's what I've just started calling my ***Unqualified General Principles of Productive Software Development***:

*Do not consume information.* Especially in the morning before work. Reading articles, watching TV, podcasts, whatever. All this has the high potential to alter your state of mind and making you, well...  less bored. Being bored and minorly issolated is the perfect enviroment for continuous creative output. Just remember to de-issolate yourself after work.

*Avoid new technology.* Learning feels productive, but it's not. It would seem like you're doing the right thing - keeping up with the latest and greatest - but remember that you got into this to build new technology, not consume it. Pick one language, one platform, one set of frameworks, and stick to it. Become the musician who no longer notices the instrument. There are a dozen cool new things on HackerNews everyday - don't be a sucker.

*Experiment before doing.* Starting a test project to try out one little thing is a valid form of productivity - as long as it has a direct connection to your real project.

*Delete and rebuild often.* Obviously don't go too crazy, but it doesn't take that long to write code if you already know what you're writing. So deleting and rebuilding is a little garentee that you really have actually fleshed out the kinks in your thinking. Even if you follow all the best practices it's easy to build yourself into a corner. Stacking the bricks of complexity around yourself until you can't see the sun. Deleting and rebuilding encourages you to really know, on a muscular level, the structure of the thing that you're building. It forces you to remember what you did awhile ago and to think again about where all this is going.

*Read history.*  When it's a good time to do some reading (after work and on weekends), choose history. Read about your craft and it's giants. Read about other industries and how things went. Read about people who accomplished big things. That’s where the wisdom is.

*Spit it out.* You should be constantly taking the fuzzy, half formed thoughts running through your head and slapping them down on the table. Once on the table, you can see them for what they are, reorganize and polish them, work the clay, chip away at the marble, throw more paint on the canvas. Nobody is looking over your shoulder - and even if they were, embarrassment is part of brainstorming. Make your internal thoughts external and you become twice as fast at seeing what needs to be done.

*Don’t expect your computer to help you with your emotional needs.* You might think you're an engineer, computer nerd, developer, a professional, but nope – you're actually a human basketcase of emotions. And in my experience that little truth is the number one cause of productivity loss. Here’s an excerpt from my personal log from a few days ago:

I’ve always had days like this (less often lately), during which I would usually spend the whole time trying to get myself “back in the zone.” These attempts never worked. The only medicine I know for this kind of thing is preventative medicine.

[I’ve changed some behaviors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO1mTELoj6o) - behaviors I didn’t think were actually that bad until recently. So while I can't give general advice on this, these are some things that made a difference for me: Meditate. Travel. Wake up at exactly the same time every morning. Run occasionally. Know at least one or two good people - spend lots of time with them. Work a solid 9-5 and no more.
