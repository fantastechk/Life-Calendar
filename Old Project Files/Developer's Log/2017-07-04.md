Developer's Log, 2017-07-04

11:44 AM: Bindings, Document-based Applications, AppKit, SceneKit, SpriteKit, Swift 4. It's a lot to learn all at once. Too much, actually. I have been feeling extremely unproductive. Now, of course, there have been other outside life type factors â€“ but I still think it's too much.

So there are a few options:

1. Pivot to targeting iOS - a platoform I know very well already.
2. Do away with bindings. I don't think I can really lose any of the others. SpriteKit, perhaps. But that's an easy one if I'm already doing SceneKit.
3. Build the entire thing using SpriteKit - limit my useage of AppKit and other Cocoa frameworks I don't know too well.

Okay - now let's talk through those options:

1. I don't want to do this because I badly want to build a mac app. However, it would speed things up with much less learning to do. But that's not a good enough reason for me. The mac is kinda the holy grail to me right now.
2. This doesn't seem like enough. I'd still have to learn Document-based Applications, AppKit, SceneKit, Swift 4. I guess I'm looking for a more drastic solution.
3. This sounds appealing because it means simplifiying down to 2D graphics, and also doing less learning - just get really good with SpriteKit, and build everything else myself. But it may be far fetched. Perhaps I really will be forced to use all the other Cocoa technologies anyway. And perhaps thats actually the right thing. Those long standing fameworks exist for a reason.


12:07 PM: After some thinking I have decided, tentatively, to go with option 3. I will spend the day exploring SpriteKit.
