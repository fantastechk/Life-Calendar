Developer's Log, 2017-07-10

10:33 AM: Now that the designs are far enough along that I know what I should be building, it's time to start creating issues and getting serious about project management. I've spent the morning so far creating a Kanban board for the next few weeks and have begun to fill it out.

10:50 AM: After some thought about how to go about possitioning the grid of tiles, I think I will attempt to place each tile statically within the SpriteKit scene. This way the content will be resized according to the `scaleMode` property of the scene. One serious limitation of this approach is (as far as I know) the fact that scrolling will not be very do-able. I think I will just have to live with that for now and make the window as tall vertically as possible. One potential problem I see is the high chance of facing some limitation with Xcode's scene editor. Also, I do not yet know how I will go about setting each individual tile's state. I'll face that unknown later.
