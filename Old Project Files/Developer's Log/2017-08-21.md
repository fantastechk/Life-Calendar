Developer's Log, 2017-08-21

11:19 AM: Okay, so last night didn't end up being as productive as I hoped. Anyway, right now I'm going to tackle creating labels for the year alongside the appropriate row.

Also today:
- [ ] When mouseOver a tile create year label left to that row and a date-span indicator above that column
- [ ] Grid and tile sizing - how do I want to make space for the labels?
- [ ] Be able to select an entire event group when only clicking on a single tile. I think I can do this by taking the `associatedEvent` of `tileAt(point)` and looking for all other tiles in `tiles` with matching event.

And in a few hours I'd like to review the whole project and see where we are at. I'm wondering how realistic it will be to finish this app by mid September.

11:40 AM: From an outside perspective I want the Grid's API to allow for:

- Variable number of years
- Number of columns can be static.
- Size of tile can be static, but should belong to the grid.
- Same goes for tile spacing.

The init should look like `init(start:end:size:position:)`, which it does already. And it is properly creating tiles based on how many weeks are between start and end.

So that's good.

12:22 PM: I still need to make the static year labels. Right now I'm thinking I'll create an array of `Label`s and fill it with instances when I go through the initial initialization. The trick will be figuring out which rows should have a label. I guess the first and last will always have one. Then devide the ultimate height of the grid by  `numberOfStaticYearLabels - 2`. Which should give you the spacing you need. Or perhaps we should go by row numbers.

5:31 PM: The static labels are basically working.

So now I should move on to creating labels on hover.
