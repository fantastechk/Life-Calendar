Developer's Log, 2017-08-18

9:41 AM: Today's goal is to get span-based tile selection working. The way I see this working is 1. the user clicks on the first tile 2. the user drags around and I take that second tile's date and 3. figure out every tile that falls between the two dates and change their color.

Also, I'm changing the tasks left for Phase 1.

Phase 1: The Grid | **Goal to finish by Monday (2017-08-21). So I have 3 days.**
- [ ] Rework `Grid` and `Tiles` to handle selection of multiple tiles. Spanning left to right, entire rows. Changing selected the tiles color and using selection to create an event **~1 more day**
- [ ] Figure out how to assosiate events and tiles to eachother **half day**
- [ ] Make static year labels fall longside the correct rows in grid **1-2 days**
- [ ] Highlight and add labels for the row+column which the user is hovering over **1-2 days**
- [ ] Stretch goal: Make some padding on tiles so there is always something selected when hoving mouse over grid **half day**
