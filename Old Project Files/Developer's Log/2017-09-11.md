4:48 PM: The design approach to how to edit these event displays is that I will allow for selection of the whole by clicking the event, or if the cursor is over one of the elements (color block, dates, title) it will select those more specific items - and bring up the editor. I will indicate selection by creating a blue rectangle around the item.

To clarify...

**Outline of editing functionality for pre-existing event views in the sidebar:**

If the mouse is hovering over the color block, a blue rectangle will appear around the color block indicating to the user that if they click they will be able to change the color for that event. This will bring up the system color picker.

If the mouse is hovering over the title text a blue rectangle will appear around the text, indicating that if the user clicks they can edit the text.

If the mouse is hovering over either of dates a blue rectangle will appear around the date text indicating that if the user clicks they will be able to change that date. This will bring up a date picker.

If the mouse is hovering over the event view, but not over one of the above items, a blue rectangle will appear around the entire event view indicating to the user that if they click it will select that event. Once selected the user can hit the delete/backspace button to remove it entirely. The user can also open the "Event" menu from the main menu bar where there are options to go into title, color, and date editing modes.

5:09 PM: What does AppKit's date picker even look like?

5:21 PM: Like this, apparently:

Good enough for now.

6:29 PM: Normally when you click on a cell in a tableview the table view adds it's own blue background to that row (or cell, idk). And it *does not* pass the mouseDown event further down the responder chain. Which means when I implement mouseDown responder methods in my `EventTableCellView` I need to set  `sidebarTableView.selectionHighlightStyle = .none` first so the table view doesn't steal the event.

But then how to I handle deselection? I could create a mouseDown on the root view which sends a deselection notification to all the tableview cells, but that sounds like a pain in the ass. Perhaps there is a better way to handle this. I expect there is and I need to know NSTableViews better.

6:54 PM: In reading the [Table View Programming Guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/TableView/RowSelection/RowSelection.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/10000026i-CH6-SW8) I am starting to think I should definitely let the table view handle all the selection state. The one hang up here is that there are not super easy ways to change the look and feel of this stuff. But it's still do-able by subclassing the row views or something. I'm looking at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9463871/change-selection-color-on-view-based-nstableview

I'm also going to watch [WWDC 2011 session 120 "View Based NSTableView Basic to Advanced"](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2011/120/) which will hopefully help solidify my understanding of table views.
