3:22 PM: Today I restyled the EventDisplay and sidebar. I also created the line class. Now I want to make the sidebar scrollable.

I also need to hook the events display sidebar up to the model timeline. Not sure where I'm going to keep that. Perhaps the VC will own it originally, and everyone else can have refs too.
