10:28 AM: Removing test stuff from bindings experiments.

10:35 AM: Going to create a basic MVC. The model will be a Timeline struct that holds an array of Event structs. The view will have two parts, a timeline view (will just display a plain text version of the Timeline), and an Event entry view where the user can input new events.

12:49 PM: Learning about how make Document Based Applications. This is the route the app should go.
