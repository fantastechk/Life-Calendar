Developer's Log, 2017-07-07

9:31 AM: For the last two days I have studied and practiced with SpriteKit. We will see how usuable it is for doing UI in time, but for now I am encouraged by it's design and usability.

11:55 AM: It's time I really started to figure out what I'm building here. I've been playing around with a few ideas. All of the most of the interesting ones are definitely too ambitious to meet my late July timeline. For now I think I'd be content with a single view app that displays your entire life in weeks. Having this foundation, I don't see why it couldn't be updated some much more experimental interfaces in the future.

Here's where the mockups are at so far:
