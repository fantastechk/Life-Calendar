Developer's Log, 2017-08-15

11:21 AM: Okay, I've been lazy about writing log entries this last week. I will be more diligent about that. I'm going to start using issues in GitHub more as well.

11:32 AM: I think I will try to upload the app to iTunes Connect ([issue #43](https://github.com/wvdk/Life-Calendar/issues/43)) today because I've never submitted a Mac app before. There might be some unexpected complications in the code signing / submission process. One thing that should happen before this is some solidification of thought about how to handle version numbering.

Should each feature branch get it's own version number?

No, I don't think so. If necessary we can give it a unique build number. But version numbers should be target, not a representation of current state.

And beyond that, lets keep it simple. `__.__` style.

12:35 PM: After jumping through a bunch of hoops getting the bundle id and code signing working I'm blocked because I cannot upload an app with a beta build of Xcode. This will have to be put on hold until Xcode 9 officially hits the shelves.

I've fixed the Sandbox issue.

12:40 PM: It's time to start thinking about all the tasks that need to get done to get this app out. I have added the labels and milestones I want to the Issues section of GitHub. This is how I will organize things (not going to use GitHub's new Projects kanban features for now. Too much overhead.

I think I have a very limited but functional data structure and persistancy model with the `Timeline` and `Event` structs. So what's left is building out all the UI.

The three main areas of the UI that come to mind are:
1. Grid of tiles for displaying and editing time spans for events. Status: In progress. Need to work out the interaction model. I think I made progress here which the little [Slider](https://github.com/wvdk/A-Swift-Vocabulary/tree/master/Slider) side project. So I'll copy that approach.
2. Sidebar for displaying and editing event details. Status: I have no idea how to build this.
3. Popups for give the user some helpful hints. Status: Might be tricky because of NSWindow stuff. I have even less of an idea.

2:45 PM: So the tasks are roughly...

Phase 1: The Grid
- Rework `Grid` and `Tiles` to handle selection of multiple tiles. Spanning left to right, entire rows. Changing selected the tiles color and using selection to create an event
- Make labels fall longside the correct rows in grid
- Make popover for tiles to display date which that tile represents

Phase 2: The Sidebar
- Get the sidebar container working. Needs to reach top of window, which will mess up current approach to making the window draggable. Solution unknown at this time. 2
- Create the variable height event stack.
- Create a TextLabel class
- Build out the event display
- Create a Button class
- Create a TextField class
- Create a DateSelection class
- Build out the event editor

Phase 3: Hint Popup
- Figure out how to display hint popups
- Build out the HintPopup class. Must disapear after time interval.
- Create a way to trigger hints to display
- Create when and what hints should display

Phase 4: Polish and submit to App Store
- Final styling. Fonts, colors, sizes, whitespace, etc.
- Create ability to open and save multiple timeline files
- Create an example timeline
- Screenshots and description for App Store
- Submit to App Store

5:48 PM: Okay, let's add rough time estimates to the items above:

Phase 1: The Grid | **Estimated time: 4-7 days**
- [ ] Rework `Grid` and `Tiles` to handle selection of multiple tiles. Spanning left to right, entire rows. Changing selected the tiles color and using selection to create an event **~2d**
- [ ] Make labels fall longside the correct rows in grid **~2d**
- [ ] Make popover for tiles to display date which that tile represents **~1d**

Phase 2: The Sidebar | **Estimated time: 11-19 days**
- [ ] Get the sidebar container working. Needs to reach top of window, which will mess up current approach to making the window draggable. Solution unknown at this time. **~2d**
- [ ] Create the variable height event stack. **~2d**
- [ ] Create a TextLabel class **~0.5d**
- [ ] Build out the event display **~1d**
- [ ] Create a Button class **~0.5d**
- [ ] Create a TextField class **~1d**
- [ ] Create a DateSelection class **~2d**
- [ ] Build out the event editor **~2d**

Phase 3: Hint Popup | **Estimated time: 5.5-9 days**
- [ ] Figure out how to display hint popups **~2d**
- [ ] Build out the HintPopup class. Must disapear after time interval. **~2d**
- [ ] Create a way to trigger hints to display **~0.5d**
- [ ] Create when and what hints should display **~1d**

Phase 4: Polish and submit to App Store | **Estimated time: 8.5-14 days**
- [ ] Final styling. Fonts, colors, sizes, whitespace, etc. **~2d**
- [ ] Create ability to open and save multiple timeline files **~3d**
- [ ] Create an example timeline **~2d**
- [ ] Screenshots and description for App Store **~1d**
- [ ] Submit to App Store **~0.5d**

Totally it looks like it could take up to 49 working days.

7:44 PM: Tomorrow I'm going to figure out a game plan taking those estimates into account. I should probably redo the README's "Future Roadmap" section too.
