Developer's Log, 2017-09-13

11:54 AM: Fresh new Xcode 9 GM seed installed. Let's do this.

11:58 AM: Today's objective: Implement custom selection graphics. Probably just a lighter blue background. I should also probably update the text to be white so it looks better on the dark background.

I think all this is outlined in the WWDC video I was talking about yesterday, but I'm going to try to figure it out with just the docs.

[Commit 13:11]    Override drawSelection(in:) with custom background color

1:12 PM: I have a custom background color working - but I actually think I'd like for it to be a blue border like the hover effect but a slightly lighter blue.

[Commit 13:16]    Change selection effect to exactly like the hover effect
[Commit 13:20]    Add hoverBorder and selectionBorder colors to Color
[Commit 13:23]    Change border colors when user selects the row

1:24 PM: Okay, that's done. Now lets figure out why / remove the a small amount of overhang on the right side of the table view rows.

[Commit 18:07]    Make column slightly smaller to avoid horizontal scrollability

6:15 PM: Okay, now let's try to make the title editable and respond to hover with outline.

7:02 PM: Now we are back to the auto layout constrains issue. If memory serves, my issue was due to the fact that I was trying to add constraints before the frame had been set. This doesn't make complete sense to me because it shouldn't matter what the frame is - a constraint will adjust automatically when that changes.

I'm going to check what the frame looks like by the end of  `init(event:)` of the  `EventView`.

7:06 PM: The frame is completely zero-ed at the ent of the `init(event:)`.

But what I am getting as a "Unable to simultaneously satisfy constraints" message. However, I do not get this message when I create a constraint that makes it attempt to be in the bottom left. So I think something is automatically adding bottom left constraints to by text field.

I am going to investigate what constraints are present before and after I `addSubview(myTextField)`.

7:14 PM: Hm. It says there are zero constraints before and after adding the subview. Only once I create my own constraind does `po constraints` contain anything.

7:18 PM: Damn. *Facepalm* - the only issue was that NSView automatically translates subview's autoresizing masks into constraints by default. This is so you can quickly get something on screen without creating constraints. But you *must* turn `translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints` to `false` if you want to do any of your own constraint stuff. This is one of those things you don't need to know if you always use interface builder and anyone who doesn't already knows it. Except dummies like me.

[Commit 19:23]    Set EventView's translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints property to false in init(event:)
[Commit 19:26]    Move the titleTextField creation stuff into init(frame:) because that's the base init

7:26 PM: Now I need to gut the `EventView.draw()` override because I'm not going to use static labels for the title or dates. Then I will need to finish adding constraints to the title text field.

[Commit 19:32]    Remove the title and date drawing from the draw() override because I'll be handling them as subviews

7:32 PM: Okay, now there is a strange thing happening. When I create new events using the grid, the new events show up how I'd expect *except* the title text view has jumped to the bottom of the `EventView` again. Not just for the new event, but for every cell in the table view. ðŸ˜±

8:30 PM: I'm calling `sidebarTableView.reloadData()` every time a new event is created by the grid. Normally I'd think something about that method causes the cells to be refreshed without hitting the `init(frame:)`, but I just checked and it is. I checked that the constraints are not there before they should be.
