4:10 PM: Today I intend to explore the options for interaction with the grid of cells I created yesterday using SceneKit. I do not yet know how the framework is designed to handle user clicks, touches, and hit testing.

5:00 PM: After some research[1][2], I have determined that the proper way to handle interaction is by putting a *gesture recognizer* onto the scene view and processing the location of those gesture detections agains a SceneKit "*hit test*". I have begun implementing this but unfortunetly I'm being called away by other obligations. It must wait until tomorrow.

> User interaction is handled in SceneKit by a combination of the UIGestureRecognizer class and hit tests. To detect a tap, for example, you first add a UITapGestureRecognizer to a SCNView, determine the tap's position in the view, and see if it is in contact with or hits any of the nodes.
