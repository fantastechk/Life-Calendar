11:12 AM: Lets get the grid and sidebar to always reflect the current timeline.

[Commit 11:30]    Create reload method stub in WeeksGrid
[Commit 11:33]    Create a private property for the WeeksGrid in WeeksViewController
[Commit 11:34]    Call weeksGrid.reload() in the event events
[Commit 11:37]    Rename Tile to WeekTile

11:40 AM: We have a few players in town. `WeekGrid`, `WeekTile`, `WeeksViewController`, `EventEventsDelegate`, `EventView`, etc.

I want both the `WeekTile` and `EventView` to update when their "associatedEvent" changes.

I could create some kind of notification mechanism. Maybe.

Events have IDs.

Timeline has an `event(for: id)` method.

Target-action? ...

12:04 PM: ... No. NotificationCenter is the way to go on this one I think.

12:11 PM: When and from where should I post a notification?

The `Timeline` model object *could* handle the following:
- Event creation
- Event fetching
- Event detail changes (title, dates, color)
- Post notifications for event changes

And we would do away with the `EventEventsDelegate`. The VC wouldn't even care. It'd initalize the sidebar, grid, and model. Then the sidebar and grid can set observers on the model and handle those event events.

12:18 PM: Or perhaps the VC should handle posting the notifications. And we keep the EventEventsDelegate, because we want that for sending changes to events from the view to the VC. Then the VC will post a notification so it's views (namely the sidebar and weeks grid) can refresh themselves with the new event.

This hopefully would allow for the `sidebarTableView` and the `weeksGrid` to nolonger require a reference to the Timeline model. The VC should act as the go between.

This feels right.

This feels tight and fresh and like the reddish sunshine on a lake with one of those floating slides which children play on it but you can only hear only silence because, thank goodness, it's far enough out that the, what I'm sure would be nerve-tweaking after a certain period of time, excited and joy-filled shouts and hollers of young children cannot travel through the high wind velocity airspace between you and the floating jungle gym type structure.
