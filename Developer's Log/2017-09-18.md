11:12 AM: Lets get the grid and sidebar to always reflect the current timeline.

[Commit 11:30]    Create reload method stub in WeeksGrid
[Commit 11:33]    Create a private property for the WeeksGrid in WeeksViewController
[Commit 11:34]    Call weeksGrid.reload() in the event events
[Commit 11:37]    Rename Tile to WeekTile

11:40 AM: We have a few players in town. `WeekGrid`, `WeekTile`, `WeeksViewController`, `EventEventsDelegate`, `EventView`, etc.

I want both the `WeekTile` and `EventView` to update when their "associatedEvent" changes.

I could create some kind of notification mechanism. Maybe.

Events have IDs.

Timeline has an `event(for: id)` method.

Target-action? ...

12:04 ... No. NotificationCenter is the way to go on this one I think.
