11:19 AM: Okay, so last night didn't end up being as productive as I hoped. Anyway, right now I'm going to tackle creating labels for the year alongside the appropriate row.

Also today:
- [ ] When mouseOver a tile create year label left to that row and a date-span indicator above that column
- [ ] Grid and tile sizing - how do I want to make space for the labels?
- [ ] Be able to select an entire event group when only clicking on a single tile. I think I can do this by taking the `associatedEvent` of `tileAt(point)` and looking for all other tiles in `tiles` with matching event.

And in a few hours I'd like to review the whole project and see where we are at. I'm wondering how realistic it will be to finish this app by mid September.
