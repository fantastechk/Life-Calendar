7:17 PM: Spending some time cleaning things up. In an effort to solidify the architecture a little let's discuss the codebase as it stands.

Firstly, we have the AppDelegate and main.swift. I think we can gloss over these, since they aren't doing anything especially unique to this app other then creating the window and main menu.

Then we have the view controller. For now, the app has a single VC called `WeeksViewController`. This VC contains a normal root view (an `NSView`) which contains a `SKView` to display the `SKScene`. All this is setup inside the `loadView` and `viewDidLoad` methods of the VC.

And then there is WeeksScene, Timeline, Event, Colors, Grid, YearLabels, Tile, TilePopup

...But I think I'll stop there, because I'd rather work on the code with the few minutes I hope to be able to steal away this Saturday night. Basically, the point is, I should eventually have a very clear understanding about how all this stuff should work together.
