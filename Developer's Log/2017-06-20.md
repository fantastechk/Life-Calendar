Developer's Log / 2017-06-20

4:00 PM: To continue where I left off on 2017-06-17, I will attempt to build out functionality that changes the color of a Cube when clicked.

7:28 PM: That was a success - color changes on click now. Additionally I cleaned up the project files and refactored the grid generation into a struct.
