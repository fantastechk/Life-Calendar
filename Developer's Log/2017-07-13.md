Developer’s Log, 2017-07-13

4:47 PM: My initial vision for Life Calendar was fairly ambitious. It was going to be a big app. And then, as my self imposed deadline of July 21st began creeping closer, I started dropping features. One by one, until I no longer recognized or felt motivated about the project.

Why did this happen? Firstly, I didn’t do a good enough job of writing down my ideas. It would have been good to create a space where I could throw things on the wall to see what stuck. But instead I kept it all in my imagination - which isn’t a very reliable storage solution. So as I began to feel deadline pressure, the features and ideas disappeared as if by magic. There was no structured, reason based decision making process. No weighing of the pros and cons. Nothing.

Secondly, that deadline. Designed to increase productivity, it ended up doing the opposite. So, from this point forward, I will be more careful with how I go about creating and maintaining deadlines.
