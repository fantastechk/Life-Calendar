10:21 AM: It's my goal to become an Ultra Productive Developer™. But some days


General Principles of Productive Software Development

Do not over engineer

Build only what you need


Start new projects
Don’t start new projects
Don’t use new technology for new projects

Experiments, Not Tests
Tests are fundamentally bullshit. Experiments ARE productivity.

Avoid Learning

Pick one language, one platform, one set of frameworks, and stick to it.

Avoid third party libraries at all costs. You think you’re doing

Don’t learn a new programming language.

Learn new concepts later.

if at all possible. Learning feels productive

Read history - that’s where the wisdom is.

Spit it out
Get the information out of your head as quickly as possible.

The human brain is good at making fuzzy creative connections. Computer are good at high fidelity information management. Use them that way. Don’t waste your time trying to make your brain do computer things. And don’t expect your computer to help you with your emotional needs.

Which leads me to my next point…

Human, Basket-Case Of Emotion

Here’s an excerpt from my personal log from a few days ago:
￼
I’ve always had days like this, sometimes strung together. But it’s a bit rarer lately. I’ve changed some behaviors - behaviors I didn’t think were actually that bad until recently.

During times like this I usually would spend the whole time trying to get myself “back in the zone.” It never worked. No fast forward.

The only medicine I know is preventative medicine.


Meditate.
Know at least one or two good people - spend lots of time with them.
Travel.
