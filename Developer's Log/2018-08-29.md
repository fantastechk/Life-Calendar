Developer's Log, 2017-08-29

8:20 AM: Good morning, computer.

Today will be all about the sidebar. Rebuilting all that using AppKit. Should be fun. Hopefully I won't get too bogged down by the differences between AppKit and UIKit.

First step - get something, anything, on screen.

8:35 AM: In order to get more familiar with how AppKit does view stuff, I'm going to follow along with Apple's [View Programming Guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CocoaViewsGuide/SubclassingNSView/SubclassingNSView.html) and make the "DraggableItemView" they use as an example.
