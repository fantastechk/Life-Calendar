Developer's Log, 2017-08-29

8:20 AM: Good morning, computer.

Today will be all about the sidebar. Rebuilting all that using AppKit. Should be fun. Hopefully I won't get too bogged down by the differences between AppKit and UIKit.

First step - get something, anything, on screen.

8:35 AM: In order to get more familiar with how AppKit does view stuff, I'm going to follow along with Apple's [View Programming Guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CocoaViewsGuide/SubclassingNSView/SubclassingNSView.html) and make the "DraggableItemView" they use as an example.

12:02 PM: Okay, cool. Got that working.

I noticed one cool thing, 

    // Support automatic scrolling during a drag by calling NSView's autoscroll method
    autoscroll(with: event)
    
in `DraggableItemView`'s `mouseDragged(with:)`. I'm going to try to put this thing in an NSScrollView.

7:53 PM: Okay, I spent all day testing things out. It's resulted in a mess of code I won't ultimately use. I'm currently cutting out *everything* that isn't essential to the current features. No more sidebar stuff, no more event display stuff, and certainly no more testing code. I need a fresh slate to rebuild the sidebar stuff.
