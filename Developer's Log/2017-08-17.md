10:01 AM: Last night and this morning I played around within the [Slider](https://github.com/wvdk/A-Swift-Vocabulary/tree/master/Slider) project on ways I might solidify my approach (using protocols mostly) to build UI using SpriteKit as a backend. While I still think this might happen long term, I've dropped these for now because I haven't reached the point where I feel like I know what I'm doing. So I'll keep tackling things in an adhock way for now.
