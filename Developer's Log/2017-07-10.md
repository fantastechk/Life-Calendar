Developer's Log, 2017-07-10

10:33 AM: Now that the designs are far enough along that I know what I should be building, it's time to start creating issues and getting serious about project management. I've spent the morning so far creating a Kanban board for the next few weeks and have begun to fill it out.

Problems with doing things programmatically
- Centering grid
- Keeping references to each tile (should I use names, tags, or something else)

Potential problems doing things by hand
- xcode's scene editor could be buggy and limited in ways I don't know yet
