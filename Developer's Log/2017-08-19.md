9:41 AM: I think that the tiles in `Grid.tiles` are not getting the correct span. When I  `po tiles[10].span` and `po tiles[20].span` I get the same dates.

11:53 AM: Okay, time aware selection is working. There are still some kinds to be worked out. I think the firstTileInSelection is not being updated when it needs to be. Also I need to make the tiles clickable areas larger so it's not so hard to select them.

12:01 AM: I should look into how the grid decides it's size and how I handle tile sizing.
