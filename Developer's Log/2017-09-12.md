Developer's Log, 2017-09-12

11:13 AM: In continuation of yesterday's table view talk I'd like to reestablish my current understanding, and then finish the 2011 WWDC video.

Firstly, you have `NSTableView`. You don't usually need to subclass it because you can use the **data source** and **delegate** for most customization and event handling. There are two somewhat distinct ways of using a table view. The first (and it would appear-old fashioned) way is using `NSCell` for, well, the cells.. Apple calls these "cell-based table views" and I've already ruled them out for my use case, so everything henceforth will be about "view-based table views". The funny thing about which is that you can use `NSView`, `NSTableCellView`, `NSTextField`, or any other `NSView` subclass. Although Apple suggests using `NSTableCellView` for reasons that are not currently clear to me, but I assume they provide some fancy table view specific methods. For now however I plan on simply subclassing `NSView` for my event displays because that means one less class to learn about. I don't like subclassing things I don't fully understand.

Okay, but getting back on track re: table views and how you use them; The **data source** provides `numberOfRows`. It also seemed to be super important to cell-based table views, but as far as I can see no other methods are required. Strangely, the documentation says about the `tableView(_:objectValueFor:row:)` method that "this method is mandatory unless your application is using Cocoa bindings for providing data to the table view." Which I say is strange because it is obviously not required. Having it or not seems to have no effect on my program. A more thorough discussion on this is on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41708427/purpose-of-tableview-objectvalueforrow), but I think this is a simple case of missleading documentation. Or Apple's definition of "mandatory" is not equal to "required". No other methods in `NSTableViewDataSource` seem to be very important to my purposes either. Some stuff for handling drag&drop, copy&paste, and sorting. I'm not doing any of that.

Which brings us to the **delegate*. This is a big guy. From the docs, "Using a table view delegate allows you to customize a table viewâ€™s behavior without creating a table view subclass. A table view delegate *provides views* for table rows and columns, and supports functionality such as column reordering and resizing and *row selection.*" Emphasis mine.

I think perhaps the best way to talk about that the `NSTableViewDelegate` protocol handles is to talk about what it does not handle. So, that leaves (as far as I know) just `NSTableRowView` and `NSTableCellView`. Because I am trying to avoid subclassing `NSTableCellView`, lets get down to buisness about it's parent in the table view family, `NSTableRowView`.

"`NSTableRowView` is responsible for displaying attributes associated with the row, including the *selection highlight*, and group row look." - the docs, emphasis mine. So I *think* we will be able to do all our custom selection stuff (outlined in yesterday's dev log) by subclassing this guy.

This [guy from Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9463871/change-selection-color-on-view-based-nstableview) says:
    You can subclass NSTableRowView, feed it to the table delegate method - (NSTableRowView *)tableView:(NSTableView *)tableView rowViewForRow:(NSInteger)row;, then customize your selection in the row view class.

    ```
    - (void)drawSelectionInRect:(NSRect)dirtyRect {
        if (self.selectionHighlightStyle != NSTableViewSelectionHighlightStyleNone) {
            NSRect selectionRect = NSInsetRect(self.bounds, 2.5, 2.5);
            [[NSColor colorWithCalibratedWhite:.65 alpha:1.0] setStroke];
            [[NSColor colorWithCalibratedWhite:.82 alpha:1.0] setFill];
            NSBezierPath *selectionPath = [NSBezierPath bezierPathWithRoundedRect:selectionRect xRadius:6 yRadius:6];
            [selectionPath fill];
            [selectionPath stroke];
        }
    }
    ```
    
I checked, `drawSelectingInRect:` method of `NSTableRowView` (I think) what draws the blue rect behind the cell. This is probably what I should use to customize the selection stuff.

I'd also like to remove the manual area tracking stuff from my `EventView`. So I need an override-able method from `NSTableRowView` or a delegate method of the table view that will let me customize the "on hover" behavior. Or perhaps I'm doing it the way I should be - `NSTrackingArea`s and all.
