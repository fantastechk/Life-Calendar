11:13 AM: In continuation of yesterday's table view talk I'd like to reestablish my current understanding, and then finish the 2011 WWDC video.

Firstly, you have `NSTableView`. You don't usually need to subclass it because you can use the **data source** and **delegate** for most customization and event handling. There are two somewhat distinct ways of using a table view. The first (and it would appear-old fashioned) way is using `NSCell` for, well, the cells.. Apple calls these "cell-based table views" and I've already ruled them out for my use case, so everything henceforth will be about "view-based table views". The funny thing about which is that you can use `NSView`, `NSTableCellView`, `NSTextField`, or any other `NSView` subclass. Although Apple suggests using `NSTableCellView` for reasons that are not currently clear to me, but I assume they provide some fancy table view specific methods. For now however I plan on simply subclassing `NSView` for my event displays because that means one less class to learn about. I don't like subclassing things I don't fully understand.

Okay, but getting back on track re: table views and how you use them; The **data source** provides `numberOfRows`. It also seemed to be super important to cell-based table views, but as far as I can see no other methods are required. Strangely, the documentation says about the `tableView(_:objectValueFor:row:)` method that "this method is mandatory unless your application is using Cocoa bindings for providing data to the table view." Which I say is strange because it is obviously not required. Having it or not seems to have no effect on my program. A more thorough discussion on this is on [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41708427/purpose-of-tableview-objectvalueforrow), but I think this is a simple case of missleading documentation. Or Apple's definition of "mandatory" is not equal to "required".
