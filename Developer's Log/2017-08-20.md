Developer's Log, 2017-08-20

8:00 PM: Tonight's goals:
- [ ] Figure out how to assosiate events and tiles to eachother
        - where shoud I keep the timeline?
        - should the events be classes?
- [ ] Create year/date-span indicators along side currently hovered row/column
- [ ] Look into how the grid decides it's size and how I handle tile sizing. I should also figure out how I want to to create padding for the labels.

And tomorrow morning I hope to accomplish:
- [ ] Make static year labels fall longside the correct rows in grid
- [ ] Be able to select an entire event when only clicking on a single tile. I think I can do this by taking the `associatedEvent` of `tileAt(point)` and looking for all other tiles in `tiles` with matching event.
