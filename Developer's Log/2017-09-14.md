10:19 AM: When I create a new event it causes the title text field to jump back to the bottom. I'm not sure what causes this.

[Commit 11:48]    Set translatesAutoresizingMastIntoConstraints off for the titleTextField, not the EventView. This is what has been causing all the strange behavior.

11:49 PM: Alright, that's fixed. Now let's work on getting the title text field showing the correct title from the event.

[Commit 12:16]    Move titleTextField to a property and set it's string value to event.title in the init(event:)

12:16 PM: Now let's update the timeline model when the text field is edited. I'm sure this will require some delegate conformance.

[Commit 14:07]    Create EventDetailsChangeDelegate and add an eventChangeDelegate property to EventView
