10:45 AM: I have "test" labels displaying to the left of the currently hovered row. But they aren't disapearing when I move the mouse away.

11:43 AM: Okay, a lot of progress has been made. Their is a dynamic label is displaying the year of the currently hovered row, and when you begin selecting the tiles between time span of start and current tiles are highlighted.

2:47 PM: The left hand hover labels are working pretty well now. I also did some cleanup and added minimizing to the main menu. Now to add the date label above the grid...

4:13 PM: Most of the grid stuff is there. Still needs lots of polish, but I'm going to move on. I need the sidebar where users can see and edit events. This will be a tricky problem I think because I don't know how many events will be needed. It'll need to be scrollable. I wonder if thats easy or not with SpriteKit.
