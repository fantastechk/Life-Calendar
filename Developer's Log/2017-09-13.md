Developer's Log, 2017-09-13

11:54 AM: Fresh new Xcode 9 GM seed installed. Let's do this.

11:58 AM: Today's objective: Implement custom selection graphics. Probably just a lighter blue background. I should also probably update the text to be white so it looks better on the dark background.

I think all this is outlined in the WWDC video I was talking about yesterday, but I'm going to try to figure it out with just the docs.

[Commit 13:11]    Override drawSelection(in:) with custom background color
