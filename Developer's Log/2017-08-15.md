Developer's Log, 2017-08-15

11:21 AM: Okay, I've been lazy about writing log entries this last week. I will be more diligent about that. I'm going to start using issues in GitHub more as well.

11:32 AM: I think I will try to upload the app to iTunes Connect (issue #43) today because I've never submitted a Mac app before. There might be some unexpected complications in the code signing / submission process. One thing that should happen before this is some solidification of thought about how to handle version numbering.

Should each feature branch get it's own version number?

No, I don't think so. If necessary we can give it a unique build number. But version numbers should be target, not a representation of current state.

And beyond that, lets keep it simple. `__.__.__` style.

12:35 PM: Blocked. I cannot upload an app with a beta build of Xcode. This will have to be put on hold until Xcode 9 officially hits the shelves.
