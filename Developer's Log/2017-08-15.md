Developer's Log, 2017-08-15

11:21 AM: Okay, I've been lazy about writing log entries this last week. I will be more diligent about that. I'm going to start using issues in GitHub more as well.

11:32 AM: I think I will try to upload the app to iTunes Connect (issue #43) today because I've never submitted a Mac app before. There might be some unexpected complications in the code signing / submission process.
