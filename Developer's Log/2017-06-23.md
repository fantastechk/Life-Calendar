Developer's Log / 2017-06-23

9:10 AM: Figuring out the right way to create overlays above the scene view is proving a little less than obvious. Still experimenting.

9:47 AM: There are a number of design patterns and bits of domain knowledge specific to macOS development that I am missing. I do not feel comfortable continuing without spending a little time reading about the proper way to approach cocoa apps. So I am reading Apple's [Cocoa Bindings Programming Topics](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CocoaBindings/Concepts/WhatAreBindings.html) and building some of the examples myself.

11:46 AM: Falling down the research rabbit hole. Going to follow [a tutorial](https://www.raywenderlich.com/141297/cocoa-bindings-macos) on Cocoa Bindings to firm up my understanding. Hopefully it wont take more than a few hours. See [Programming-Exercises/Cocoa Bindings](https://github.com/wvdk/Programming-Exercises/tree/master/Cocoa%20Bindings/AppResearchBindings-Starter) for the project files.
