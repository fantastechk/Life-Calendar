1:40 PM: Where did I leave off last time?

Ah yes, I was trying to get the grid and sidebar to always reflect the current timeline. And I was learning NotificationCenter so I could broadcast event changes and the grid and sidebar could respond to those notifications.

1:59 PM: So here's my todo list:
- [ ] Update `Timeline().events` to be set-private.
- [ ] Create a `newEvent()` type of method to `Timeline`
- [ ] Create a temporary mock `Event` in the `WeeksViewController`'s `createNewEvent()`
- [ ] Use the menubar's "New Event" item to test adding an event to the timeline
- [ ] Get the sidebar tableview reloading when a new event is added to the timeline
- [ ] Get the `WeeksGrid` to render the `events` argument by changing colors for those tiles. Perhaps look into creating "tile groups" for each event.
- [ ] Get the grid to responde to new event notifications and render them onscreen

Unfortunately I think they will need to wait until Monday due to life-reasons.

[Commit 14:02]    Add an events: [Event] argument to WeeksGrid's init
