10:46 AM: I have a grid of tiles displaying on screen. I have a column of year labels displaying along side it. But neither is hooked up to any temporal information. The tiles don't know what week they represent. So I've given them each a span: TimeSpan property. This property needs to be set when I generate each tile. So Grid needs to be able to create progressive week long TimeSpan values.
