9:51 AM: When the user selects tiles in the grid that needs to generate a new event in the events timeline.

11:09 AM: Okay, here's the architecture for now:

1:39 PM: Now I should work on "edit mode" for event display's.

3:11 PM: I have a stange phenomenon happening. When I hover an EventDisplayNode, it's background changes color, which I want. But one of it's neighbors also become highlighted. This could be two things. 1. I'm setting the background rect path wrong. Or 2. mouseMove is triggering for two nodes at once.
