Developer's Log, 2017-08-26

9:51 AM: When the user selects tiles in the grid that needs to generate a new event in the events timeline.

11:09 AM: Okay, here's the architecture for now:

1:34 PM: The new architecture is mostly done and new events are being created and displayed/

1:39 PM: Now I should work on "edit mode" for event display's.

3:11 PM: I have a stange phenomenon happening. When I hover an EventDisplayNode, it's background changes color, which I want. But one of it's neighbors also become highlighted. This could be two things. 1. I'm setting the background rect path wrong. Or 2. mouseMove is triggering for two nodes at once.

7:48 PM: Slightly reworked mockup:

8:06 PM: Okay, so I've run up against something of a wall. I mean, I'm going to pivot. Initially I wanted to build *everything* in SpriteKit. But the sidebar. It's a scrollable talbeview with editable textfields. Thats a whole lot to build into spritekit. Especially the text fields. Taking input text properly is simple not something I want to deal with right now. I could, in theory, use NSResponder's `keyDown` and `keyUp`, to do basic keyboard input of text. But to hand everything at the level that users have come to expect from a computer, that would be a huge undertaking. All for the somewhat arbitrary goal of using only SpriteKit.

9:15 PM: The thing that worries me is the lines. The connecting likes that help you see which items in the sidebar match up to which tiles in the grid. I'm woried about trying to get points for each item in the tableview. I'm unsure of what technology to use to render the lines. It's all unknown. That worries me, but I'm going to just push forward anyway and hope I can figure it out in the future.

Now, I need to focus on getting a list of events displaying in a tableview.
