Today I attempted to use SceneKit to create a grid of red cubes on a white background layed out along the x & y plane. Prior to today I had not worked with the SceneKit framework for anything serious before. Making a grid was the the easy part - a nested for loop did the trick. Something like...

```swift
for row in 0...numberOfRows {
    for column in 0...numberOfColumns {
        createCell(x: row * rowHight, y: column * columnHight)
    }
}
```
The intricacies and domain knowledge of working with the SceneKit framework proved to be quite time consuming. However I expect the learning curve to soften and I'm quite happy with the results thus far.

Additionally I did some miscellaneous project cleanup including:
- Flattening of directory structure
- Removed GitHub Pages stuff
- Simplification of Developer's Log naming scheme
- Deleting some unused files
