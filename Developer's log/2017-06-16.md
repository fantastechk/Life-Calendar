Today I will attempt to use SceneKit to create a grid of red cubes on a white background layed out along the x & y plane. I have not worked with the SceneKit framework before, so I expect there to be a bit of a learning curve. Making a grid should be the easy part - a nested for loop ought to do the trick. Something like...

```swift
for row in 0...numberOfRows {
    for column in 0...numberOfColumns {
        createCell(x: row * rowHight, y: column * columnHight)
    }
}
```


Project cleanup including:
- Flattening of directory structure
- Removed GitHub Pages stuff
- Simplification of Developer's Log naming scheme
